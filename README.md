This Python script implements a simple Caesar cipher encryption and decryption tool. The Caesar cipher is a classic substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
Features
- Encrypts and decrypts messages using a user-defined shift value
- Preserves case sensitivity (uppercase and lowercase letters)
- Leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged
- Includes both demo examples and an interactive command-line interface
Functions
- caesar_encrypt(text, shift): Encrypts the input text by shifting alphabetic characters
- caesar_decrypt(text, shift): Decrypts the input text by reversing the shift
- main(): Provides an interactive CLI for users to choose encryption or decryption
Usage
Run the script directly to see demo examples and interactively encrypt or decrypt your own messages.
